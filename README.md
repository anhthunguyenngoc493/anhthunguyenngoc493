A business student, a novice data scientist, and a lifelong learner.

I am currently a third-year university student at Foreign Trade University, majoring in business and economics with a keen focus on data science. My journey as a business student intertwines seamlessly with my passion for leveraging data to drive insights and solve business challenges. As a lifelong learner, I am driven by a relentless curiosity, committed to continuous learning and eagerly embrace new challenges to further develop my skills in data analysis and machine learning.
